Introduction
------------
Adaptive Comparative Judgement (ACJ) is based on the law of comparative judgement conceived by L. L. Thurstone in 1927 as a method for psychological measurements.
First used for psychological measurements, today it offers an alternative to marking, especially for performance assessments for which achievement can be difficult to describe in mark schemes and for those where inter-marker reliability is often a problem.

This application is based on an updated 2012 paper which details ACJ's method and history.
Students answer questions asked by instructors or other students and are then able to compare and judge the given answers. From these comparisons, a score for each answer is calculated according to ACJ's methods.


Frameworks
----------
The frontend is purely written in Javascript, using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) as a MVC-framework and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the design.
The backend uses the python web application framework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) with [Flask SQLAlchemy](http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/) for database persistence.
[Alembic] (http://alembic.readthedocs.org/) is used to maintain database updates.

Developer Installation - Docker
-------------------------------

### Development Prerequisites

* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Clone Repo and Start Server

    git clone git@github.com:ubc/compair.git compair
    cd compair
    npm install
    node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js
    node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js prod
    docker-compose up -d

After initialization is finished, run the following command if it is the first time:

    docker exec -it compair_app_1 python manage.py database create

Alternatively you can create a pre-populated database with demo data:

    docker exec -it compair_app_1 python manage.py database create -s

ComPAIR is accessible at

    http://localhost:8080/

### Check Logs

    # app
    docker logs -f compair_app_1
    # nginx
    docker logs -f compair_web_1
    # db
    docker logs -f compair_db_1

### Stop Server

    docker-compose stop

### Stop Server and Clean Up

    docker-compose down
    rm -rf .data

### Access Database

    docker exec -it compair_app_1 mysql

### Upgrade Database

    docker exec -it compair_app_1 alembic upgrade head

### Run Management Command

    docker exec -it compair_app_1 python manage.py COMMAND

### Build Docker Image Locally

    docker build -t ubcctlt/compair-app .

### Upgrade

    docker-compose down
    docker pull ubcctlt/compair-app # download latest ComPAIR image
    docker-compose up
    docker exec -it compair_app_1 alembic upgrade head # upgrade database

Running tests
---------------------------

### Testing Prerequisites

`libxmlsec1-dev` is an additional system requirement for using `python3-saml`. If you would like to run your tests locally, you need to install it with:

    # brew
    brew install libxmlsec1
    # apt-get
    apt-get install libxmlsec1-dev
    # yum
    yum install xmlsec1-devel

### Python unit tests:

    make testb

### AngularJS spec tests:

    make testf

### AngularJS acceptance tests:

    make testa

Generate Production Release
---------------------------
Run `gulp prod` to generate the production version. This currently just does two things:
1. Combine all Bower managed javascript libraries into a single minified file.
2. Compile and minify the less files into a single css file.


Setting up Learning Analytics
---------------------------

ComPAIR uses the Experience API (xAPI) for collecting learning analytics. xAPI requires a [Learning Record Store (LRS)](http://tincanapi.com/learning-record-store/) to use.
ComPAIR currently only supports basic OAuth1 authentication connections to the LRS. Authentication can be set with either `LRS_USERNAME`+`LRS_PASSWORD` or `LRS_AUTH`.

For development, you can set `LRS_STATEMENT_ENDPOINT` to either the 'local' setting (to dump statements into the `xapi_log` table) or to an account on [https://lrs.adlnet.gov/](https://lrs.adlnet.gov/) for your LRS.
Note that [https://lrs.adlnet.gov/](https://lrs.adlnet.gov/) is set up for testing purposes only and they can clear their data at any time (do not use in production).

### Settings

`XAPI_ENABLED`: Set to 1 to enable collecting learning analytics (disabled by default)

`LRS_STATEMENT_ENDPOINT`: Set the url LRS. Use 'local' for dumping statements into `xapi_log` table ('local' by default)

`LRS_USERNAME`: The username for the OAuth1 account.

`LRS_PASSWORD`: The password for the OAuth1 account.

`LRS_AUTH`: Must be in the format `Basic LRS_USERNAME:LRS_PASSWORD` where `LRS_USERNAME:LRS_PASSWORD` has been base64 encoded.

`XAPI_APP_BASE_URL` Optionally set a base url to use for all statements. This is useful to help keep statement urls consistent if the url of your instance changes over time or is accessible though different routes (ex http+https or multiple sub-domains). (Uses base url of request by default)

xAPI statements require an actor (currently logged in user) account information. The ComPAIR account information will be used by default unless the following settings are changed.

`LRS_ACTOR_ACCOUNT_USE_THIRD_PARTY`: Flag indicating if SAML/CAS account information should be used by default if available (disabled by default)

`LRS_ACTOR_ACCOUNT_THIRD_PARTY_HOMEPAGE`: Set the homepage of the SAML/CAS account

`LRS_ACTOR_ACCOUNT_CAS_IDENTIFIER`: Optionally set a param to set as the actor's unique key for the CAS account. (uses CAS username by default)

`LRS_ACTOR_ACCOUNT_SAML_IDENTIFIER`: Optionally set a param to set as the actor's unique key for the SAML account. (uses value associated with `SAML_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER` by default)

`LRS_USER_INPUT_FIELD_SIZE_LIMIT`: Set the byte limit on xAPI statement fields containing user input. Set this in order to prevent sending large statements to the LRS that it can't handle (1048576 by default or 1MB)

Restart server after making any changes to settings

(Optional) Setting up Background Tasks
---------------------------

### Settings

`CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER`: Set to 1 to disable background tasks (off by default)

`CELERY_BROKER_URL`: Set the url for the broker tool to be used (ex: redis or rabbitmq instance url)

`CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`: Set the backend to store results (disabled by default)

`CELERY_TIMEZONE`: Set the timezone used for cron jobs. Currently only used for demo installations ('America/Vancouver' by default)

Workers will need to be restarted after any changes to them.

if `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER` is on, then all background task calls will run locally and block until completed (effectively disabling background tasks).
See the [Celery CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER docs](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/configuration.html?highlight=CELERY_BROKER_URL#celery-always-eager).

Restart server after making any changes to settings

User Authentication Settings
---------------------------

ComPAIR needs at least one of the following settings to be setup so that user can login. Through, you can also enable multiple ones. e.g. you can use both CAS and LTI.

### APP Login Settings

`APP_LOGIN_ENABLED`: Enable login via username & password (default: True)

Restart server after making any changes to settings

### CAS Login Settings

`CAS_LOGIN_ENABLED`: Enable login via CAS server (default: False)

`CAS_SERVER`: Url of the CAS Server (do not include trailing slash)

`CAS_AUTH_PREFIX`: Prefix to CAS action (default '/cas')

`CAS_USE_SAML`: Determines which authorization endpoint to use. '/serviceValidate' if false (default). '/samlValidate' if true.

`CAS_ATTRIBUTE_FIRST_NAME`: Optionally automatically sync user's first name with the supplied CAS attribute (Will only override if attribute is present a contains content).

`SAML_ATTRIBUTE_EMAIL`: Optionally automatically sync user's email with the supplied SAML attribute (Will only override if attribute is present a contains content).

You must provide `SAML_SETTINGS` or `SAML_SETTINGS_FILE` to use SAML Login. See [python3-saml](https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml) for details on setting up the JSON settings.
You can use `SAML_METADATA_URL` and `SAML_METADATA_ENTITY_ID` to fetch the idp's public metadata for very request.
You can use `SAML_EXPOSE_METADATA_ENDPOINT` to expose public metadata for the idp.

`libxmlsec1-dev` is an additional system requirement for using `python3-saml`. If you would like to run your tests locally, you can install it with

    # brew
    brew install libxmlsec1
    # apt-get
    apt-get install libxmlsec1-dev
    # yum
    yum install xmlsec1-devel

Note: [https://www.testshib.org](https://www.testshib.org) is used for using saml authetification for development purposes. `deploy/development/dev_saml_settings.json` contains testing settings and should not be used in production. if you edit `dev_saml_settings.json`, you must upload it to [https://www.testshib.org/register.html](https://www.testshib.org/register.html). Please also replace `deploy/development/compair_dev_saml_metadata.xml` with the metadata so it can be kept track of.

### LTI Settings

`LTI_LOGIN_ENABLED`: Enable login via LTI consumer (default: True)

Restart server after making any changes to settings

In addition, you must create a LTI consumer key/secret by:
- Logging into ComPAIR as a system administrator
- Clicking on 'Manage LTI' in the header
- Clicking 'Add LTI Consumer'
- Entering a unique key and a hard to guess secret and clicking 'Save'

You can enable/disable consumers from the Manage LTI screen as needed

(Optional) Email Notification Settings
-----------------------------

Run `gulp prod` in order to generate the combined minified css used in the html emails.

`MAIL_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED`: Enable email notifications application wide (default: False).

Even if notifications are enabled, users can disable them for themselves on the edit account screen.

See [Flask-Mail](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/#configuring-flask-mail) for details on configuration settings for mailing notifications.

Disable outgoing https requirements
-----------------------------

`ENFORCE_SSL`: Enforce https on all requests made though LTI and CAS (default: True)

Can be used to disable secure SSL requirements for outgoing and incoming traffic from LTI and CAS.
Note that SAML https settings should be adjusted in `SAML_SETTINGS` or `SAML_SETTINGS_FILE`.
This should only be used for development or staging purposes.

Setup a demo installation
-----------------------------

Demo installations have default data of one course, 2 assignments, 1 instructor, and 30 students. Demo installations do not allow editing/deleting the course, assignments, student answers, or enrollment of any automatic generated default data. Users can still create other courses, assignments, etc and modify them as needed. **Demo installations also allow anyone to create system administrators, instructors, and students at any time.** If the cron job is setup, all data will be automatically reset to defaults every day at 3:00 a.m.

**You should never turn a server with existing data into a demo.** Always delete all existing data first with:

    python manage.py database drop

### Demo Settings

`DEMO_INSTALLATION`: Turns the ComPAIR installation into a demo (default: False)

Setting `DEMO_INSTALLATION` to True will also force `APP_LOGIN_ENABLED` to True and `CAS_LOGIN_ENABLED` to False. `LTI_LOGIN_ENABLED` may still be optionally set to True or False if you want to allow LTI connections to be made to the demo installation.

### Additional Setup

In order for the cron job to work properly, you must also create an additional celery process (ex: `celery beat -A celery_worker.celery`). You should also set `CELERY_TIMEZONE` to your preferred timezone so that the automatic scheduler will reset properly at 3:00 a.m. in your timezone.

You can set the data the first time by running:

    python manage.py database create

(Optional) Kaltura Media Attachments
---------------------------

You may optionally enable Kaltura uploads to support more media file attachment types with better cross browser playback compatibility.

It is highly recommended to create a seperate account for ComPAIR so it does not interfere with other content. ComPAIR treats the account provided as a bucket account to store all video/audio uploads. You should have a Kaltura player setup and configured for the account.

Currently only version 3 of the Kaltura api is supported.

### Settings

`KALTURA_ENABLED`: Set to 1 to enable uploading media attachments to a Kaltura account (off by default).

`KALTURA_SERVICE_URL`: The base url of the Kaltura server.

`KALTURA_PARTNER_ID`: The partner id of the Kaltura account.

`KALTURA_SECRET`: The secret for the partner id provided.

`KALTURA_USER_ID`: The user id (email) of the Kaltura account.

`KALTURA_PLAYER_ID`: A Kaltura player id (conf ui id) to display the media in.

`ATTACHMENT_UPLOAD_LIMIT`: The file size upload limit (in bytes) for all attachments including Kaltura uploads. (default 250MB).

`KALTURA_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS`: Set of video file extensions that will be uploaded to the Kaltura instead of ComPAIR (default: mp4, mov, and webm).

`KALTURA_AUDIO_EXTENSIONS`: Set of audio file extensions that will be uploaded to the Kaltura instead of ComPAIR (default: mp3).

Restart server after making any changes to settings

Student Data Privacy Settings
-----------------------------

You can control data accessibility for certain sensitive fields with the following settings

`EXPOSE_EMAIL_TO_INSTRUCTOR`: Set to 1 to allow instructors to see and modify email address for students in any of their classes (disabled by default). Instructors can see email info by exporting their class lists or view one of their student's profiles.

`EXPOSE_THIRD_PARTY_USERNAMES_TO_INSTRUCTOR`: Set to 1 to allow instructors to see CAS/SAML usernames for students in any of their classes (disabled by default). Instructors can see CAS?SAML username info by exporting their class lists

In addition you can control if students are able to edit their first name, last name, display name, and student number. System admins and instructors can still modify these profile fields. Any student disabled field for editing will be automatically updated with values from LTI or CAS/SAML on login. Please check the LTI, CAS, or SAML sections for additional environment variables that may need to be included (for example if student number is disabled, then `CAS_ATTRIBUTE_STUDENT_NUMBER` need to be set for automatic updated on student login)

`ALLOW_STUDENT_CHANGE_NAME`: Allows students to edit their first & last names (default: enabled).

`ALLOW_STUDENT_CHANGE_DISPLAY_NAME`: Allows students to edit their display name (default: enabled).

`ALLOW_STUDENT_CHANGE_STUDENT_NUMBER`: Allows students to edit their student number (default: enabled).

`ALLOW_STUDENT_CHANGE_EMAIL`: Allows students to edit their email address (default: enabled).

Google Analytics Web Tracking
-----------------------------
1. Register for a Google Analytics web property ID at http://www.google.ca/analytics/.
2. Set `GA_TRACKING_ID` to your web property id (ex: 'UA-XXXX-Y')

Restart server after making any changes to settings
